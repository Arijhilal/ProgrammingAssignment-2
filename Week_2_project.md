Week 2 project
==============

Part 1:Loading and processing the data:
---------------------------------------

``` r
setwd("C:/Users/ahilal/Desktop/Data Science Specialization/Coursera Course 5/Week 2 assignment")
library(ggplot2)
unzip("activity.zip")
dataset <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Part 2: Finding the mean total number of steps taken per day:
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Calculating the total number of steps taken per day:

``` r
TotalStepsPerday <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = dataset,FUN = sum)
```

### Drawing a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

``` r
qplot(steps, data=TotalStepsPerday)
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

### The mean of the total number of steps taken each day is:

``` r
mean(TotalStepsPerday$steps)
```

    ## [1] 10766.19

### The median of the total number of steps taken each day is:

``` r
median(TotalStepsPerday$steps)
```

    ## [1] 10765

### Seperating NA values

``` r
NAvalues <- is.na(dataset$steps)
```

Part 3:Average daily dctivity pattern analysis:
-----------------------------------------------

### A time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days

``` r
Cleandataset <- dataset[!NAvalues,]

Averagesdataset <- aggregate(steps~ interval, Cleandataset,FUN = mean)

plot(Averagesdataset$steps,type="l",col="green",lwd=1.5, xlab = "Interval",ylab = "Average number of steps")
```

![](Week_2_project_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

### The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, containing the maximum number of steps:

``` r
MaxInterval <- Averagesdataset[which.max(Averagesdataset$steps),]

MaxInterval
```

    ##     interval    steps
    ## 104      835 206.1698

Part 4: Missing values:
-----------------------

### The total number of missing values is

``` r
sum(NAvalues)
```

    ## [1] 2304

### Mergin with the original data set matching the average number of steps with the intervals

``` r
names(Averagesdataset)[2] <- "mean.steps"

dataset2 <- merge(dataset,Averagesdataset)
```

### replacing the NA values with the average

``` r
dataset2$steps[is.na(dataset2$steps)] <- dataset2$mean.steps[is.na(dataset2$steps)]
```

### Calculating the updated total number of steps taken per day:

``` r
TotalStepsPerday2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = dataset2,FUN = sum)
```

### Drawing an upated histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

``` r
qplot(steps, data=TotalStepsPerday2)
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](Week_2_project_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

### Finding the updated mean and median:

``` r
mean(TotalStepsPerday2$steps)
```

    ## [1] 10766.19

``` r
median(TotalStepsPerday2$steps)
```

    ## [1] 10766.19

### As shown below the mean does not change but the median does

``` r
mean(TotalStepsPerday2$steps)-mean(TotalStepsPerday$steps)
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
median(TotalStepsPerday2$steps) - median(TotalStepsPerday$steps)
```

    ## [1] 1.188679

Part 5: Weekdays vs weekends:
-----------------------------

### finding the day:

``` r
dataset2$weekdays <- weekdays(as.Date(dataset2$date))
```

### Splitting between weekend and weekday

``` r
dataset2$weekdays <- ifelse(dataset2$weekdays == "Sunday" | dataset2$weekdays == "Saturday", "Weekend","Weekday")
```

### Finding the means and splitting between Weekdays and Weekends

``` r
AveragesdatasetWeekdays <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + weekdays,dataset2, FUN = mean)
```

### Plotting the 2 graphs:

``` r
ggplot(AveragesdatasetWeekdays, aes(x = interval, y=steps, color=weekdays)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(weekdays ~ .) +
  labs(title = "Mean of Steps by Interval", x = "interval", y = "steps")
```
